# Corpus of Corrections

A concordance-type overview of linguistic corrections in the experimental corpus samples (1847-48, 1852, 1855, 1860-61, 1875, 1890). Included in this overview are all and any corrections of (potential) linguistic features in the Icelandic student essays (*ísl. ritgjörð*) as well as the Icelandic-Danish translations (*ísl. stíll*). 

Corrections of spelling and punctuation are NOT included yet. 

The ODF-formatted (`.ods`) file contains underlining as an approximation of the location/extent/nature of each correction but does not indicate whether singly, doubly or triply underlined/dotted/overwritten etc. Corrections are annotated for `variable` which states the basic feature involved (including subcategories), `corrected` which states whether or not a feature was corrected, `teacher` stating the teacher (where known), `class` stating the grade (grades 1-4, later 1st to 6th grade), `assignment` indicating the type of assignment (essay or translation), `year` specifying the year as stated by the box or assignment sleeve, `pupil` stating the name of the student, `file` referencing the image filename, `loc` indicating the image path (see TO DO) and, finally, `note` with some minor remarks, unclear features etc.
