**Corpus of Reykjavík Grammar School Student Essays (1846-1904)**

Containing samples from 1847-48, 1852, 1855, 1860-61, 1875, 1890. A partial, experimental XML/TEI-based version of the text (1847-48) along with corrections by the teacher(s) of grammar, punctuation and style, transcribed using the HisTEI framework (see examples/screenshots below). The transcriptions are freely available here on GitHub, along with the photographed samples from 1852, 1855, 1860-61, 1875 and 1890. In addition, a sample Corpus of Corrections based on this material will soon be available in CSV format, along with references to the photographs.

– *Feel free to join in!* Over a thousand pages here on GitHub just waiting to be transcribed. This is less than 5% of the whole amount of Icelandic student assignments (1847-1909) preserved at the National Archives of Iceland, based on a rough estimate.
