**Corpus of Reykjavík Grammar School Student Essays (1846-1904)**

A partial, experimental XML/TEI-based version of the text (1847-48) along with corrections by the teacher(s) of grammar, punctuation and style, transcribed using the HisTEI framework. Containing samples from 1847-48, 1852, 1855, 1860-61, 1875, 1890 (see also examples/screenshots below). The transcriptions are freely available here on GitHub, along with the additional photographed samples from 1852, 1855, 1860-61, 1875 and 1890 (6 boxes). In addition, a preliminary sample *Corpus of Corrections* based on this material is now available in ODF format (`ods`) along with references to the photographs.

   *Feel free to join in!* 

Over a thousand pages here on GitHub are just waiting to be transcribed. This is but a fraction of the whole amount of Icelandic student assignments (1847-1909) preserved at the National Archives of Iceland, contained in no less than 123 boxes. (Approx. 1 box per year until around 1880, later at least 2 and more often 3-4 boxes per year.)
